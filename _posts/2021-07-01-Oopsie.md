excerpt: "This machine is a 'Starting Point', I liked intrusion more than privilege escalation, accessing a panel using credentials from another machine, I brute-forced a URL parameter (id) and found a user with more privileges, I managed to change the view of the page and get a reverse shell to go up in PHP, for its escalation I found a program that was running cat without its absolute path, this was PATH hijacking."

Start with an Nmap scan to see what ports the machine has open.

```bash

Once the scan was complete, I performed another scan to detect the version and service of each port found.

I had a Server and an SSH service that I couldn't do much with, I tried fuzzing to see if there were any potential directories.

The "uploads" directory I would like to think will have to point to some file later, look at the web server.

I found a route in the source code that caught my attention that said /cdn-cgi/login/script.js, I removed the script.js, copied the route and put it next to the IP of the machine and it reported a "Log In" panel.

![primera](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124141179-7b5d0300-da89-11eb-962d-6a1adacefb58.png)

After some research on this panel, I found nothing critical about it and had to see this part in another *Write Up*, apparently the access credentials are from the previous "Starting Point" machine, that is [ArcheType](https://wackyhacker.github.io/hackthebox/ArcheType/), the username is **admin** and the password **MEGACORP_4dm1n!!**.

![cuarta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124149303-be6ea480-da90-11eb-91f7-01e2e3e52e35.png)

Once inside, this is what you saw.

![Captura de pantalla (635)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124151061-718bcd80-da92-11eb-886f-62670dd6ee06.png)

The section that particularly caught my attention was "uploads", I clicked on it to see if it would allow me to upload any files.

![Captura de pantalla (636)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124151263-a7c94d00-da92-11eb-97b8-2523bdea9495.png)

And apparently there is a user with more privileges than **admin**, I had to become him in order to upload a file.

![Captura de pantalla (636)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124152207-9df41980-da93-11eb-9ba6-7d0e304fa5a7.png)

Seeing this I decided to click on the "accounts" section and I saw that the URL reported an ID that was 1.

![Captura de pantalla (638)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124153495-c7fa0b80-da94-11eb-8759-b4e1d6f59070.png)

This ID corresponded to the admin user I was in, I thought about doing brute force and maybe getting an ID from another user and with a bit of luck the one from the user with the most privileges, for that I created a sequencer from 0 to 100 for the dictionary, I exported it to a **dic.txt** file and now all that was left was to intercept the request with *BurpSuite* and send it to the "intruder", I selected "sniper" as the attack type and the "payload" to attack, in this case the ID, I started the attack and finally I found the user **superadmin** in a server-side response different from the others.

![burpsuite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124153658-f11a9c00-da94-11eb-9c5b-f3712d9b8d74.png)

The superadmin user ID was 30, I intercepted another request but this time from the "uploads" section.

![Captura de pantalla (639)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124154575-e9a7c280-da95-11eb-8966-52bc6b10aa96.png)

I changed the data in the user parameter and put in the user **superadmin**.

![Captura de pantalla (640)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124156323-caaa3000-da97-11eb-8be1-706b5571c0c0.png)

I clicked "forward" and it redirected me to the file upload page.

![Captura de pantalla (641)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124156420-e7defe80-da97-11eb-88a1-6e719bfb7745.png)

I uploaded a reverse shell in PHP, I used the one from [Pentestmonkey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php).

![Captura de pantalla (642)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124156717-40ae9700-da98-11eb-944b-91736b0a27e3.png)

I intercepted the request again.

![Screenshot (643)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124156991-908d5e00-da98-11eb-921a-6e5ce32d461f.png)

Change the "user" parameter of the request to that of the **superadmin**.

![Captura de pantalla (644)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124157173-c3cfed00-da98-11eb-9a34-d18a3a92d23a.png)

I clicked forward to issue it and upload the reverse shell.

![Captura de pantalla (645)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124157309-ecf07d80-da98-11eb-9d6b-02958156a100.png)

Now where has it been uploaded? Well, if we remember at the beginning of everything we did "fuzzing" to find potential directories, there was one called "uploads", I tried pointing to that directory with the name of the reverse shell and opening port 443 via NC to receive the connection, and indeed it was there.

![revershell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124157701-58d2e600-da99-11eb-8c9a-0999b3411711.png)

I tried using the TTY to navigate the Shell more comfortably and tried to view the user's "flag". Apparently I didn't have permissions, there was a user called Robert. I thought I had to become that user to be able to view it. After a little search in the system I managed to find a file in /var/www/html that had some credentials for the user Robert.

![robert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124158077-c717a880-da99-11eb-934e-b7be647fc1b2.png)

I tried authenticating via SSH, since the machine had it open, and it worked.

![sshrobert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124158185-e282b380-da99-11eb-90c6-dc476c9f4cf3.png)

<hr>
<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

I viewed the flag, and now all that was missing was the privilege escalation, I found a binary called bugtracker, after intuiting what it was doing I saw that a cat was being executed behind the scenes and apparently it was not pointing from its absolute path, so this was a PATH hijacking like a house, I created a file called cat with "/bin/bash" as content and modified the PATH to point to the directory I am in now, I gave the file execution permissions and ran the bugtracker binary and became the ROOT user.

![root](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124158822-b0be1c80-da9a-11eb-960d-16c65a4b4d8c.png)

I tried to display the flag, but it seemed like it had nothing, I had to encode it in hexadecimal and the two potions at the end together make up the ROOT user flag.
