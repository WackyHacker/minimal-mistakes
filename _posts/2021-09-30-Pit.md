excerpt: "This is a medium difficulty machine, to break into it I took advantage of an SNMP MIB to enumerate, I found a user and a web server path, a control panel reported to me and I accessed it with Michelle as username and password, I was able to upload a 'webshell' taking advantage of a panel exploit, I managed to escalate privileges by taking advantage of a binary that was executed when scanning SNMP with a MIB."

Start with an `Nmap` scan for open ports.

```

`Nmap` found me three open ports, one for `SSH` and the other two for web servers, I started by looking at the web server running on port `80`.

![https://imgur.com/qFYlUkX.png](https://imgur.com/qFYlUkX.png)

Apparently there was nothing interesting, I decided to fuzz to find directories, but I found nothing.

![https://imgur.com/n8cA6Sk.png](https://imgur.com/n8cA6Sk.png)

When accessing port `9090` I was redirected to a different domain, I saw that `virtual hosting` was being applied, that is, storing different domains in the same `IP`, for this I included the domains `dms-pit.htb` and `pit.htb` that `Nmap` reported to me in `/etc/hosts`.

![https://imgur.com/yPgRicj.png](https://imgur.com/yPgRicj.png)

I tried to access port `9090` again and found a `403 FORBIDDEN`.

![https://imgur.com/k7O1fNq.png](https://imgur.com/k7O1fNq.png)

Seeing that I didn't find anything interesting in `TCP` I decided to try `UDP` and see if it had any open ports. To do this I used the `udp-proto-scanner.pl` tool and found `snmp` open on port `161`.

![https://imgur.com/4p4Ve4k.png](https://imgur.com/4p4Ve4k.png)

So I tried enumerating `snmp` with `onesixtyone` to see if I could find any "community strings" that I could use to find information, and I decided to clone a dictionary of them.

![https://imgur.com/HdglhGw.png](https://imgur.com/HdglhGw.png)

When performing the recognition I found the `public` tag.

![https://imgur.com/WO9jVR9.png](https://imgur.com/WO9jVR9.png)

Thanks to this "community string" I was able to list information with `snmpwalk`, but I found nothing.

![https://imgur.com/qjdeNBC.png](https://imgur.com/qjdeNBC.png)

Thinking for a while I realized that I could list more information with `MIB's`, for this I used the `MIB` `NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull`.

![https://imgur.com/QLtcEIr.png](https://imgur.com/QLtcEIr.png)

I found a route that caught my attention.

![https://imgur.com/GGi4Mhi.png](https://imgur.com/GGi4Mhi.png)

Testing the route on the web servers, the only one that responded was the one running on port `9090`.

![https://imgur.com/zZbSgP7.png](https://imgur.com/zZbSgP7.png)

It was a login panel, I looked to see if there was an exploit available.

![https://imgur.com/ovcmTNp.png](https://imgur.com/ovcmTNp.png)

I found an exploit that granted remote execution of arbitrary code, but I needed to be authenticated in the panel, by doing "password spraying" I managed to access with the user and password `michelle` that had been reported to me in the `snmp` enumeration.

![https://imgur.com/eKN8Ijz.png](https://imgur.com/eKN8Ijz.png)

![https://imgur.com/SEl8Kwt.png](https://imgur.com/SEl8Kwt.png)

Inside the panel I found a folder called `Docs`.

![https://imgur.com/2gaAYqN.png](https://imgur.com/2gaAYqN.png)

In it I found another one called `Users`.

![https://imgur.com/FbzRLdj.png](https://imgur.com/FbzRLdj.png)

Accessing it I found two other folders, one called `michelle` and another `Jack`, I accessed the `michelle` folder, since it is the user with which I am authenticated, excuse the redundancy, in it I found a section that apparently allowed me to add documents.

![https://imgur.com/069DBCI.png](https://imgur.com/069DBCI.png)

This was the form that was presented to me.

![https://imgur.com/nRw5TeD.png](https://imgur.com/nRw5TeD.png)

I put the name of the `webshell` and selected it.

![https://imgur.com/NmNHo7T.png](https://imgur.com/NmNHo7T.png)

And I uploaded it.

![https://imgur.com/5Otq7el.png](https://imgur.com/5Otq7el.png)

I needed your ID, that's what it was in the url for.

![https://imgur.com/n7lt6a8.png](https://imgur.com/n7lt6a8.png)

And I gained arbitrary code execution.

![https://imgur.com/1YHeAfB.png](https://imgur.com/1YHeAfB.png)

I wanted to create a `reverse shell` but it seems that there was some kind of restriction and it wouldn't let me, so I had to use a tool, `ttyoverhttp`, this tool from **s4vitar** allows the execution of arbitrary code in a `shell` without having to use a "FakeShell" or establish a socket, this tool makes use of the `mkfifo` utility, just copy the path of the `webshell` and paste it in the corresponding section.

![https://imgur.com/gWQhVq9.png](https://imgur.com/gWQhVq9.png)

I ran it with `Python3` and got `RCE`.

![https://imgur.com/b1EjTf5.png](https://imgur.com/b1EjTf5.png)

Enumerating the system a bit I found a `settings.xml` in `/var/www/html/seeddms51x/conf`, this had credentials.

![https://imgur.com/DeQcKKq.png](https://imgur.com/DeQcKKq.png)

These were used to authenticate myself in the `CentOS Linux` login panel using the user `michelle`.

![https://imgur.com/ZGWRCQx.png](https://imgur.com/ZGWRCQx.png)

This was the panel.

![https://imgur.com/c8UiYHk.png](https://imgur.com/c8UiYHk.png)

What caught my attention the most was the Terminal section, accessing it I found a kind of remote Shell, I was able to see the user flag and establish a `reverse shell` to my machine.

![JNrU6Tu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/135674024-d55f71fa-3955-4b13-a661-967578f90601.jpg)

And I received the shell.

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

For privilege escalation I found this binary `/usr/bin/monitor`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for script in /usr/local/monitoring/check*sh
do 
	/bin/bash $script
done 
```

Seeing this reminded me of something from `snmp`, when I executed the enumeration with the `MIB` `NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull`, there was a "delay" of waiting time until the enumeration was executed, this was produced by a binary called the same, `/usr/bin/monitor`.

![https://imgur.com/kcf9jnk.png](https://imgur.com/kcf9jnk.png)

So I thought that somehow there could be a connection, this script would run any script called `check` followed by something and `.sh` stored in the path `/usr/local/monitoring`, what I did was create a pair of keys with `ssh-keygen` and create a script that copies them to `/root/.ssh/autorized_keys`, this way if the user is privileged he could log in to `ssh` without providing credentials, I first created the keys.

![https://imgur.com/qb5B8f8.png](https://imgur.com/qb5B8f8.png)

Now I created the script and transferred it to the `/usr/local/monitoring` path, running the enumeration again with `snmp` with the `MIB` `NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull`, the script was executed and I was able to access the machine via `ssh` with the public key, I was now able to view the `root` user "flag".
