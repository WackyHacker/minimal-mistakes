excerpt: "This is an easy machine, I liked the intrusion more than the privilege escalation, for its intrusion I managed to make 'directory listing' and get to see WordPress credentials, I authenticated with the administrator user, I managed to modify the 404 template and embed a reverse shell, in the privilege escalation it allowed me to execute the initctl binary with any user, I modified a service and got root"

Start with an Nmap scan to see what ports the machine has open.

```bash 
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ nmap -sS -p- --open --min-rate=5000 -Pn -n 10.10.10.229 -oG allPorts

```

Perform another scan to verify the service of each port.

```bash

I started by looking at the web server as I couldn't do much on ports 22 and 3306.

I clicked on an option and it looked like Virtual Hosting was being applied.

I also checked the source code to see if there was more than one domain.

Copy the domain and paste it into /etc/hosts so that the host points to the domain and you can see what the WEB actually has.

I was dealing with a WordPress.

![Screenshot (606)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528045-e18e0280-d6e4-11eb-8752-7a7099875db6.png)

Check to see if you have the login panel and if you have it.

At this point I thought I'd go back to the original website to make a better list.

![Screenshot (603) (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528121-7264de00-d6e5-11eb-837f-7c9ac711a2a8.png)

At first glance, nothing relevant is seen.

![Screenshot (603) (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528153-a50ed680-d6e5-11eb-991f-bebf02d3a335.png)

But if we look at the URL it seems that there is a "directory listing" capability, I pointed to "testing" and it could indeed list system files.

![Screenshot (609)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528175-d38cb180-d6e5-11eb-9fa3-1ec1fcf6bc72.png)

There was the WordPress configuration file that usually has the access passwords, I opened it.

![Screenshot (610)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528241-56157100-d6e6-11eb-8694-affe0ed90193.png)

It seems that there is nothing, but if we look at the source code we can see its content.

![Screenshot (611)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528288-75140300-d6e6-11eb-8b8c-08bb6d93d265.png)

I tried to authenticate with the username and password they gave me, but with no luck.

When testing with the administrator user, I am authenticated.

Now all that was missing was the intrusion, I thought about modifying the 404 error template, but it wouldn't let me.

![Screenshot (616)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528425-22871680-d6e7-11eb-9682-ee62fad22e96.png)

I changed the subject and it worked for me.

![Captura de pantalla (619)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528443-48142000-d6e7-11eb-89a2-0725f62fce63.png)

But that "reverse shell" didn't work for me, I had to change it, I tried the [Pentestmonkey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) one and it worked for me, I accessed "http://10.10.10.239/main/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/404.php" and received the reverse shell on port 443, I tried the TTY to handle it more comfortably.

I tried to view the user's flag but I didn't have permissions, apparently I had to become the user **katie**.

![Screenshot (622)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528629-1b610800-d6e9-11eb-81f1-baa0a1cc0f31.png)

After a little enumeration of the system I found a script in "/opt".

I saw what it was doing and found a path that had a file called "passwd" stored, I viewed it and found a text string.

![Captura de pantalla (624)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528676-97f3e680-d6e9-11eb-8f92-39da1435c558.png)

The machine had SSH enabled, so I tried authenticating and had no luck.

![Screenshot (625)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528701-ca054880-d6e9-11eb-8132-9ec275533e71.png)

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

Now I was able to view the user flag, see if I could run something as the *ROOT* user with the `sudo -l` command and had the ability to run **intictl**.

![Captura de pantalla (627)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528745-2700fe80-d6ea-11eb-88d9-8b5201ec4645.jpg)

**Initctl** allows us to manage user jobs, I thought about running the binary with sudo, **initctl** works with the service configuration files in /etc/init, so I modified one of those services to assign it a bash with SUID privileges.

![Captura de pantalla (628)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/123528923-ebffca80-d6eb-11eb-9bd8-e417b5f5a49e.png)

Save the file, start the service, bash was set as SUID, so I ran ```bash -p``` and got ROOT access
