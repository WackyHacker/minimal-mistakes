excerpt: "This is an easy machine, for the intrusion I took advantage of a vulnerable version of Drupal that was running on the system and gained RCE, I had to migrate to another user, for this I found MySQL credentials that helped me find a hash, after breaking it the credential was of the user I had to migrate to, for the privilege escalation I took advantage of snap, since it could be executed with sudo privileges."

I started by running an `Nmap` scan to detect open ports and services on the system.

```bash 
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/wackyh4cker/HTB/Armageddon]
â””â”€$ nmap -sS --min-rate=5000 --open -v -n 10.10.10.233 -oN targeted

 I did another scan to detect the version of each service found.

I saw that he had a web server, I took a look at it.

I found a Drupal CMS, thought I'd check if there was any exploit and found the following.

![exploit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127578743-4233e86c-f010-478e-96ec-558de362dbdf.png)

I executed it by giving it the website URL and it granted me arbitrary code execution.

![drupalgeddon2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127578821-64748b45-715f-49ea-b03f-1a8a789a767a.png)

Now all that was left was to open a reverse shell to gain access to the machine. I tried a `bash` `reverse shell` but it detected a "bad character", so I had to use a `python` one.

![entrada](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127578935-84be425c-c97e-4f50-9415-c7ce2b71ce73.png)

And I got a connection via `netcat`

![reverseshell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127578974-241fd99f-8b3f-4783-80d6-ac0d648f7737.png)

After a little research on `Google` I found that credentials are stored in a file called `settings.php`.

![credencialesdrupal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579080-1bfebdce-534d-4b71-81e1-1f2f3992d6e4.png)

I filtered that file with `find` and found credentials

![drupalcreds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579123-79d4bb64-5c8c-4d18-8ad7-fb7e86012ce8.png)

It was a user and a password, I tried in `SSH` but it didn't work, but when I tried in `mysql` it did work, but it hung, so I had to execute the statement in the same command, I tried to list the tables.

![tables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579240-4228535d-4557-45ec-bcbf-81f197f88ba5.png)

The `users` table caught my attention so I selected `name` and `pass` from the `users` column and it reported a `hash`.

![hashdecontra (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579502-c8690364-ef70-4c36-a0bd-6f458cf0f5f3.png)

I was able to brute force crack it with `john`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/wackyh4cker/HTB/Armageddon/Drupalgeddon2
â””â”€$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash

This credential authenticates me via `SSH` using the system user `brucetherealadmin`.

I was now able to view the user's "flag".

![flagdelusuario (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579644-4ec95b78-ef93-4fa2-b47b-f5694ec3cac3.jpg)

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

For privilege escalation it allowed me to run `snap` with `sudo` permissions, I searched in [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io) and found that I could take advantage of it by using `sudo`.

![Screenshot (661)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/127579819-ada222e3-d01a-4b9f-bbe1-aeb66e3aedae.png)

When running a command I got a problem that I was able to solve by installing the corresponding gem.

```ruby
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/wackyh4cker/HTB/Armageddon/Drupalgeddon2
â””â”€$ gem install fpm
```

Now if I let the malicious `.snap` file be created on my machine, I had it run `cat /root/root.txt` to see the `root` flag.

Once exported to the victim machine I used the command that allowed me to execute `snap` with `sudo` privileges and selecting my `.snap` followed by the parameters `--dangerous` and `--devmode` and it reported the "flag" in clear text.
