I started by doing a scan with `Nmap` to detect the ports and services that the machine has open.

Seeing that there was a web server, I headed over to it.

I had a login panel, I looked at the source code and noticed some routes that caught my attention.

I accessed `/login.php?guest=true` and found a conversation between the user and the `admin`, the user left a link that had another route, look what it had.

I had a few hashes, I thought they might be credentials for the main page login.

Crack the first one with `john the ripper`.

I validated the user `hazard` who had a conversation with the `admin` and the cracked credential with `crackmapexec` and it turned out to be successful.

I tried different users in the `login` panel but no luck, I also tried to see if I had access to any shared resources with `smbclient` but found nothing.

![intentodesmbclient](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126851397-b9fea407-265a-42cd-b4b2-e7549af64b19.png)

I thought of another alternative, try to dump more users with the user `hazard` and the password cracked with `john` using the tool `lookupsid.py`.

![usodelookupsid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126850981-bc0420c1-02c7-4f84-969a-9b33ed53973e.png)

I dumped a few of them, and with the ones I had I created a user dictionary to brute force another password cracked from another `hash`.

![crackpassword](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126851207-714391ca-d5f0-40b3-ab84-93028d6df85a.png)

For brute force I used the `crackmapexec` tool, it detected that the user `Chase` was valid.

I authenticated with `evil-winrm` and I could now see the user flag.

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

For privilege escalation I found Firefox processes running on the system.

![findstr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126851324-2bc5a76f-1395-46a0-8281-504efba8da70.png)

I downloaded the `procdump64.exe` utility and dumped it into a Firefox process.

![procdump](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126851553-49029543-9416-4f31-a570-ba723a913da4.png)

I made a string from the dump and exported it to a file called `cred.txt`, filtered it by `login.php` and it reported some credentials, I tried to validate them with `crackmapexec` using the `Administrator` user.

![pnwed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/126851662-aa62dce3-e58d-4993-b0a7-bb41b2cb3262.png)

Dio `pwned` that allowed me to log in with `psexec` with maximum privileges.

I was also able to access it with `evil-winrm`.
