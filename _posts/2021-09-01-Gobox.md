excerpt: "This is a medium difficulty machine, for its intrusion I took advantage of a buffer vulnerable to 'SSTI' on a server with GO and managed to enumerate deposits with AWS and upload a 'webshell' in PHP to the web server, for the escalation of privileges I managed to find a backdoor nginx module and found the parameter that I needed for the 'RCE' as the 'ROOT' user.

I started with an `Nmap` scan for open ports.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/kali/HTB/Gobux]
â””â”€# nmap -sS --min-rate=5000 -n -vvv --open -Pn 10.10.11.113 -oG allPorts

I did another scan to find out the version of each open port found.

```bash

There were two web servers, the one running on port `80` had the following.

Apparently there was nothing interesting, in the second one I found something different.

![https://imgur.com/XRw6QZA.png](https://imgur.com/XRw6QZA.png)

There were two buffers but I had no credentials, I tried to see if it was vulnerable to `SQLi` but no luck, it asked me to enter an email.

![https://imgur.com/8o24U6Z.png](https://imgur.com/8o24U6Z.png)

There was a button called "Forgot Password", I clicked it and it took me to another buffer.

![https://imgur.com/KZJetmj.png](https://imgur.com/KZJetmj.png)

I sent a request via `GET` and thanks to the headers I identified that `Go` was running on the web server, this caught my attention.

![https://imgur.com/jpnKkc5.png](https://imgur.com/jpnKkc5.png)

I also tried `SQLi` on this buffer but still no luck.

![https://imgur.com/EwhF8wK.png](https://imgur.com/EwhF8wK.png)

I made up an email and entered it, and it said it was sent.

![https://imgur.com/dylVlfD.png](https://imgur.com/dylVlfD.png)

I wanted to intercept the request to see how everything runs behind the scenes, so I used `burp`.

![https://imgur.com/6VreJyc.png](https://imgur.com/6VreJyc.png)

Knowing that `GO` runs on the server I remembered `nmap`, I saw that it reported a page title suspicious of a vulnerability.

![https://imgur.com/ApK3ETK.png](https://imgur.com/ApK3ETK.png)

I looked into whether a server running `GO` could be vulnerable to `SSTI` and found the following.

![https://imgur.com/umgsZbr.png](https://imgur.com/umgsZbr.png)

It was possible to identify and confirm if it was vulnerable with "{{" "." "}}", I immediately tried it in the `email` field and it reported the following.

![https://imgur.com/FgrhFqM.png](https://imgur.com/FgrhFqM.png)

Apparently it is vulnerable, it reported to me in plain text some credentials that apparently could be from the "buffers" at the start, I entered them and it redirected me to a page with a code.

![https://imgur.com/c1UEcmF.png](https://imgur.com/c1UEcmF.png)

What caught my attention the most is the `DebugCmd` function.

![https://imgur.com/vGoAv9m.png](https://imgur.com/vGoAv9m.png)

It seemed to allow me to execute code on the system by passing it arguments, I tried it in `burp`.
 
![https://imgur.com/cDNEAxv.png](https://imgur.com/cDNEAxv.png)

And it worked, I tried to see the `IP` it had, but the `ifconfig` command did not exist, I also wanted to check if the machine could have connectivity with me but neither the `ping` command nor the `wget` command existed.

![https://imgur.com/ZSuCUtG.png](https://imgur.com/ZSuCUtG.png)

This made me think it was in a container, I looked at the `/proc/net/fib_trie` file and it was indeed in a container.

![https://imgur.com/w3i498N.png](https://imgur.com/w3i498N.png)

After some desperate time I found that I had the `aws` command enabled, that caught my attention, this would allow me to list and copy buckets, actually more things could be done, but I'm not interested.

![https://imgur.com/7wNaj68.png](https://imgur.com/7wNaj68.png)

I tried listing the repositories and found one called `website`.

![https://imgur.com/l7QaVBG.png](https://imgur.com/l7QaVBG.png)

I accessed it and found something that caught my attention, the files that were there seemed to be communicating with the web server that runs on port `80`, so I thought that if I managed to include some file I could have access to it from the web server, before that I tried to list the `aws` credentials that were stored in `~/aws/credentials`.

![https://imgur.com/UO0QRes.png](https://imgur.com/UO0QRes.png)

And I was able to list them.

![https://imgur.com/DqqNclW.png](https://imgur.com/DqqNclW.png)

They were useful for me to have connectivity from my machine, but I wasn't interested in that, so I tried to include a `webshell` in PHP to the web server, I had to encode it in `urlencode` otherwise it wouldn't let me, I exported it to `/tmp` with the name `reversess.php`.

![https://imgur.com/LHsv5I7.png](https://imgur.com/LHsv5I7.png)

And I managed to get it into the bucket with the `aws` `cp` parameter.

![https://imgur.com/fDV4XnZ.png](https://imgur.com/fDV4XnZ.png)

I went to the web server and got arbitrary code execution.

![https://imgur.com/cTcPnbb.png](https://imgur.com/cTcPnbb.png)

To establish a `reverse shell` I created a `txt` file with the code that would allow me to gain access to the system and opened a web server on port `8000`.

![https://imgur.com/Y0G7wKq.png](https://imgur.com/Y0G7wKq.png)

I did a `curl` from the `webshell`.

![https://imgur.com/VjK4TCF.png](https://imgur.com/VjK4TCF.png)

And now I just piped the code into `bash` and gained access as the `www-data` user.

![https://imgur.com/ikL9Wqm.png](https://imgur.com/ikL9Wqm.png)

I did some TTY workaround and was now able to view the user's flag.

<hr>
<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

Now all that was missing was the privilege escalation, I listed the `SUID` privileges but found nothing interesting.

![https://imgur.com/S04sYGq.png](https://imgur.com/S04sYGq.png)

Listing a little more I found a web server listening on port `8000`, what caught my attention the most is that it is only accessible from `localhost`, I decided to investigate the `nginx` modules and found one that caught my attention a lot, called `50-backdoor.conf`, I did a `cat` on it and it reported a route in clear text, after researching it on the internet I found that there was a backdoor.

![Captura de pantalla (16)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/131731107-7086603b-e2bb-4812-b671-97b43bccf1bd.png)

But to activate it I needed the parameter that was configured, to find the parameter I needed a copy, for this I filtered the file name with `find` and found it.

![https://imgur.com/zDLUO81.png](https://imgur.com/zDLUO81.png)

I did a `strings` and filtered by `run` to find it in a faster way and I managed to find it.

![https://imgur.com/iOKieyF.png](https://imgur.com/iOKieyF.png)

Now all that was left was to send a request to the server at `localhost` using the parameter found and I would get command execution as the `root` user.

![https://imgur.com/Yx7dg2D.png](https://imgur.com/Yx7dg2D.png)

And now I could see the `root` flag.
