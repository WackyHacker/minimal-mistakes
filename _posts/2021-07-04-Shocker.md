excerpt: "This is an easy machine, the experience has not been frustrating due to its ease. While fuzzing I found a directory called cgi-bin so I thought it might be a shellshock, while fuzzing again I found a script called user.sh, and it was vulnerable to shellshock, once I gained access to the machine I took advantage of Perl because I could run it with sudo."

I started by running an `Nmap` scan to identify any open ports on the machine.

```bash 
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ nmap -sS --min-rate=5000 -v -Pn -n 10.10.10.56 -oG allPorts

I also did another scan to verify the version and service of each open port.

```bash

Apparently I only had two ports, I started with the web server, there was little I could do with the SSH service, this was what I saw.

I didn't find anything, so I resorted to fuzzing with `WZFuzz`.

![miherramienta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124386715-f74e8980-dcdb-11eb-8ffb-9591b5ab20c7.png)

I found a `/cgi-bin/`, this looked like a full blown `shellshock`, I fuzzed it with `wfuzz`, to see if I could find a bash script.

![fuzzer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/124386763-35e44400-dcdc-11eb-9387-501de5ea0565.png)

And yes, I found a script called `user.sh`, to confirm that it was a `shellshock` I used the script [exploit-deface.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2014-6271/master/exploit-deface.sh) and it was indeed vulnerable to `shellshock`, I ran the following command sending a GET request via `curl` to see if it returned the `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ curl http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh -H "custom:() { ignored; }; echo Content-Type: text/html; echo ; /bin/cat /etc/passwd"
```

Yes, it returned the contents of `/etc/hosts`, now I just needed to access the machine, I started a reverse shell using "netcat" on port `443` and accessed it.

<hr>
<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

Now all that was missing was the privilege escalation, for this I did `sudo -l`, I saw that I could run Perl with `root` privileges, I went to [gftobing](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to see if I could escalate privileges in some way with Perl, apparently I could.

I run the command with `sudo` and give myself superuser permissions.
