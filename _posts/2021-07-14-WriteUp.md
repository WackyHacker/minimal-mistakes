excerpt: "This is an easy difficulty machine, I quite liked this machine, the intrusion was fun, I took advantage of a vulnerable version of `CMS Made Simple`, the `exploit` I used exploited a `SQL` vulnerability, once I gained access to the machine I had a few issues escalating, until I saw that it was running run-parts without their absolute path when starting `SSH`, so I took advantage of a PATH hijacking."

I started by doing a scan with `Nmap` to detect open ports.

```bash
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]

Perform another scan to detect the version and service of each open port.

```bash

I had two ports open, one `SSH` and the other an `http` server, this is what the web server had.

I tried to fuzz the website, but it seemed that some kind of rule was being applied at the `iptables` level and it wouldn't let me, I looked at the `robots.txt` and found an interesting route called `writeup`.

This is what the page had.

I did a `whatweb` on the page and saw that it had a `CMS Made Simple`

```bash
┌─[root@parrot]─[/home/wackyhacker/Desktop]
└──╼ whatweb http://10.10.10.138/writeup/

```

I searched for a `CMS Made Simple` exploit and found one that took advantage of `SQLi` --> [46635.py](https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/46635), it asked me for a dictionary, I put `rockyou.txt` in it and the attack started, it cracked my password in a matter of 1 minute or so.

![cracked](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/125533829-f855d278-eb09-4d3e-98bc-25423d5d7bf6.png)

The machine had `SSH` open so I tried to authenticate with the password I had obtained using the `jkr` user and it worked, I could now see the user's "flag".

<h1 align="center"><b>ESCALADA DE PRIVILEGIOS</b></h1>

Now all that was missing was the privilege escalation, for this I spent some time investigating the machine until I found that a task was being executed at regular intervals of time when starting `SSH`, the task is called `run-parts`, basically what it does is ask you for a directory and it will execute each "script" that is inside, but the important thing is not this, but that the task is being executed without using the absolute path, so this was a `PATH hijacking`.

![run-parts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69093629/125534498-d9360e31-b8e4-4f17-b76b-9b22d85c54dd.png)

To get `root` I did a `which` to `run-parts` to see its absolute path and then I went to that directory to create a file called `run-parts` that assigns `SUID` privileges to `bash`, I gave it execution permissions, I copied the `run-parts` file created by me to the absolute path of the `run-parts` task, I restarted the `SSH` session and reconnected and became `root` by assigning the `bash -p` command, I could now view the `root` "flag".
